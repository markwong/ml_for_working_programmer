(* QUESTION:
Verify that U+ is commutative and associative. (Hint: recall the extensional equality of functions.)

CORRECT ANSWER:
It is an easy consequence of the corresponding properties of addition.
To show b1 U+ b2 = b2 U+ b1 it suffices by extensionality to show
(b1 U+ b2)(x) = (b2 U+ b1)(x), which is equivalent to b1(x)+b2(x) = b2(x)+b1(x).
Associativity is similar.
