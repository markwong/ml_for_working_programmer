QUESTION:
What does it mean to say that 'sum' correctly computes the sum of two
polynomials? How might you prove it?


CORRECT ANSWER:
One could say that 'sum' itself amounts to a definition of polynomial addition,
but this reduces our problem to a triviality. Moreover it refers to a particular
representation of polynomials: it is too concrete.

We could adopt a more abstract definition of polynomials, such as sets of
(exponent, coefficient) pairs with non-zero coefficients. We could define
addition of such sets quite easily. Then the correctness of 'sum' is analogous
to the correctness of 'union' discussed in Section 3.22
